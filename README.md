<h1 align='center'> Heart Rate Monitor </h1>

  The project aims to design, make, and test a wearable heart rate monitor that can accurately measure pulse rate, with a specific focus on assisting elderly individuals with heart
  arrhythmia. This device will empower elderly residents in retirement homes to monitor their heart rates independently, without requiring assistance. Moreover, it comes with a
  built-in LED light and a small speaker that generates an alert sound if the heart rate is too high or too low. This feature notifies caretakers so they can take necessary medical
  tests and precautions. STM32F401RE microcontroller, C++ programming language, 3D printing are some of the main technologies involved in this project.
