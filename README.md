<h1 align='center'> Heart Rate Monitor </h1>

<p align='justify'> 
  The project aims to design, make, and test a wearable heart rate monitor that can accurately measure pulse rate, with a specific focus on assisting elderly individuals with heart
  arrhythmia. This device will empower elderly residents in retirement homes to monitor their heart rates independently, without requiring assistance. Moreover, it comes with a
  built-in LED light and a small speaker that generates an alert sound if the heart rate is too high or too low. This feature notifies caretakers so they can take necessary medical
  tests and precautions. Our project is a collaborative effort of two individuals and is expected to be finished by the second week of December. Our project proposal and design
  document (which are added to the respiratory) received a combined score of 94% from an external examiner. This project helped me enhance my skills and knowledge in the  
  STM32F401RE microcontroller, C++ programming language, 3D printing, and other components.
